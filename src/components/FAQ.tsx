    question: 'Will this course help me for FAANG interviews?',

    question: 'Will I get a certificate?',
    answer: `Yes, upon completion of the course, you will receive a certificate that you can add to your LinkedIn profile and resume. However, the real value is in the knowledge and skills you'll gain, which will translate directly to interview success and on-the-job performance.`

    id: 6,
    question: 'How is this different from free YouTube tutorials?',
    answer: 'While free resources can be helpful, they often lack structure, depth, and real-world context.
